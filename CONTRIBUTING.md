## Install things! ##
Make sure to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system.  
Then, in the repository run
```
npm install
```

If you ever get an error of a missing node module, you can always look at its name (it will have a message *Error: Cannot find module `module`*) and run
```
npm install **module**
```

Run in your console
```
node index.js
```
