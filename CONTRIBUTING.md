## Install things! ##

### Node JS ###

Make sure to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system.  
Then, in the repository run
```
npm install
```

If you ever get an error of a missing node module, you can always look at its name (it will have a message *Error: Cannot find module `module`*) and run
```
npm install **module**
```

Run in your console
```
node index.js
```
***

### Prettier ###
Install [prettier] (https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)
To quickly format the project, run
```
npx prettier --write .
```
